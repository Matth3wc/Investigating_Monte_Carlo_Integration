# Investigating_Monte_Carlo_Integration
This project was completed as part of the Hamilton Summer Research internship in Mathematics at Trinity College Dublins' Hamilton Institute for Mathematics. Members involved are Matthew, Oran, and Tomas. Our supervisor is Pof. Stefan Sint.

Our project explores the differnt sampling methods used in Monte Carlo Integation. We explore uniform sampling, importance sampling, discretised importance sampling utilising markov chains, Hybrid MCMC + KDE to estimate unknown PDFs. We hope to progress to implementing some basic normilisation flow techniques as an additional method to use in Hybrid MCMC integration.

We will compare the arious methods using their variances, run time, memory usage, and other things too...

We will prgress to a variety of samplers, starting with metropolis hastings,  then progressing to gibbs, hamiltonian and more.
